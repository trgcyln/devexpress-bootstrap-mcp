These controls extend the classic DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms controls and target the ASP.NET Web Forms platform while using Bootstrap as a front-end framework. The DevExpress Bootstrap Controls are highly configurable and support numerous customization scenarios. The fundamental feature of DevExpress Bootstrap controls is their native rendering to Bootstrap CSS classes. When a DevExpress Bootstrap control renders its markup, the control does not strictly define its client-side presentation. Instead, the control’s presentation is supplied by the Bootstrap framework and Bootstrap themes. The described paradigm offers the following advantages. Application-level adaptivity Accessibility out of the box Consistent look-and-feel across browsers and devices Out-of-the box integration with Bootstrap themes supplied by Bootstrap contributors and third-party developers The inherent advantage of using Bootstrap for constructing web user interfaces is that it allows you to develop responsive layouts and provides your web application with production-quality visual design from the start. The markup to which the controls are rendered is based on standard Bootstrap classes and is intended to be integrated into bootstrap-powered page layouts. As a result, the controls behave as an integral part of the layout – they scale to the display size, use the look-and-feel settings from the current Bootstrap theme and visually merge with the page. NoteStyle settings of our ASP.NET WebForms controls can affect style settings of Bootstrap controls, for instance, when you place a Bootstrap control inside the ASPxPanel control. The following ASP.NET Bootstrap libraries and controls are provided by DevExpress. Grid View Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager NoteThe controls listed below are designed for Bootstrap v4 and may have rendering issues in Bootstrap v3.

All DevExpress .NET products have localizable resources for UI elements such as dialog boxes, button captions, menu items and error messages. By localizing the application resources, you can provide an interface that is specific to a particular culture or locale. Via Satellite Resource Assemblies. This is the most common localization approach provided by the .NET Framework and is supported by all DevExpress products. Localizing ASP.NET Controls via Localizer Objects. This is a simple approach, supported by DevExpress controls, to replace control resources with new text. UI Localization Client The UI Localization Client is a cross-platform utility that allows you to quickly identify non-translated strings of DevExpress UI controls and translate them during a debug session. The utility automatically generates a RESX file(s) with translated resources and adds it to the project.

For instance, our Bootstrap Grid View control sends callbacks to filter, sort, or edit data. Callback states are stored in an encoded hashed format within hidden fields. To address security-related issues, the server uses MachineKey to encrypt callback state before passing it to the client. The same algorithms and key values encrypt ASP.NET forms-based authentication, view state, and callbacks for DevExpress ASP.NET Bootstrap controls.

For example, you can use a summary to display the number of records in the data sample or the maximum column value. NoteIn server mode, a summary cannot be calculated for unbound columns in which values are calculated via events (see ASPxGridView.CustomUnboundColumnData). Only columns with unbound expressions (see GridViewDataColumn.UnboundExpression) support summary calculation. This document consists of the following sections: Summary Types Summary Items Custom Summaries Summary Types Bootstrap Grid View supports two types of summaries: Total Summary A total summary represents the value of an aggregate function calculated from all rows within the Grid View and is displayed in the footer. Group Summary A group summary represents the value of an aggregate function calculated from all rows within a group and displayed in the group row or group footer. Summary Items ASPxSummaryItem objects stored in the Grid View‘s ASPxGridView.GroupSummary and ASPxGridView.TotalSummary collection properties represent a summary (both group and total). The following two summary item properties must be specified to display a summary: The ASPxSummaryItemBase.FieldName property specifies the name of the data source field in which values are used for summary calculation. The ASPxSummaryItemBase.SummaryType property specifies the aggregate function type. ASPX <dx:ASPxSummaryItem FieldName=\"Total\" SummaryType=\"Sum\"/> The summary item above summarizes the ‘Total’ field values within a group and displays the sum in the group row.

When filtering is applied to Bootstrap Grid View, only data rows that meet the specified criteria are displayed. Data can be filtered against a single data column or multiple data columns. The Bootstrap Grid View allows its data to be filtered by column values or display text. This is controlled by the column’s GridDataColumnSettings.FilterMode property. Filtering by display text is ignored in database server mode. End-users can build simple filter criteria, and apply it using the Filter Row or the Header Filter of a column. The comparison operator used in a filter condition is determined by the GridViewDataColumnSettings.AutoFilterCondition property of a column. End-users can select the filter condition via the context menu, which is invoked by clicking a filter row button. The following eleven operators are available.

To enable the sorting feature, set the column’s GridDataColumnSettings.AllowSort property to True. If this property is set to Default, the column’s behavior is controlled by Grid View’s ASPxGridBehaviorSettings.AllowSort option. NoteBy default, Bootstrap Grid View does not sort a column if its data items do not implement the IComparable interface. To sort such columns, you can do one of the following. Manually implement the IComparable interface for column data items. Implement custom column sorting. For this purpose, set the column’s GridDataColumnSettings.AllowSort property to true, set the GridDataColumnSettings.SortMode property to Custom, and implement a custom sorting algorithm within the ASPxGridView.CustomColumnSort event handler. Sorting at Runtime End-users can sort data against a data column or change a column’s sort order by clicking its header. The column’s current sort order is indicated by the sort glyph displayed at the column header’s right edge. If the column isn’t sorted, the sort glyph is hidden. If sorting isn’t applied, clicking a column’s header sorts data by its values in ascending order. If sorting is already applied to a column, subsequent clicks reverse the current sort order. A regular click on a column header clears the sort settings on other columns. To preserve the existing sort settings of other columns, hold the SHIFT key down while clicking. This can be useful when sorting against multiple columns. To clear a column’s sorting, click its header while pressing the CTRL key. Sorting in Code Server To apply sorting to a column(s), use one of the following methods. Set the column’s GridViewDataColumn.SortOrder property to ColumnSortOrder.Ascending or ColumnSortOrder.Descending. Call the column’s GridViewDataColumn.SortAscending or GridViewDataColumn.SortDescending method.

Use the ASPxGridViewEditingSettings.Mode property to specify the grid edit mode. NoteBy default, all data editing operations are prohibited. To allow row insertion, deletion, and updating, enable the corresponding options available through the BootstrapGridView.SettingsDataSecurity property. To allow end-users to manipulate data in either of the edit modes listed below, add a Command Column to the ASPxGridView.Columns collection and specify which commands can be used by end-users. End-users can switch The Bootstrap Grid View to edit mode by clicking the Edit command. Or, use the ASPxGridView.StartEdit method to switch to an edit mode in code. To switch The Bootstrap Grid View back to browse mode and save all changes made, click the Update command or use the ASPxGridView.UpdateEdit method. To discard the changes, click the Cancel command or call the ASPxGridView.CancelEdit method. The following edit modes are supported.

The control can automatically resize or hide grid data when the browser window is resized. The layout behavior mode is specified by the ASPxGridViewAdaptivitySettings.AdaptivityMode property using the following values. HideDataCells (Responsive Layout) HideDataCellsWindowLimit (Adaptive Layout) Responsive Layout To enable the responsive layout, set the ASPxGridViewAdaptivitySettings.AdaptivityMode property to HideDataCells. In responsive mode, the grid automatically hides columns one by one when the browser window is resized and cell text becomes truncated. The order in which columns are hidden is controlled by the GridViewColumn.AdaptivePriority property. When a grid has hidden columns, an Ellipsis button (a Show adaptive detail button) is displayed for every row. The buttons are contained in the adaptive column whose position can be specified using the ASPxGridViewAdaptivitySettings.AdaptiveColumnPosition property. The ellipsis button’s click expands an adaptive detail row that contains hidden data. You can specify the number of columns displayed in an adaptive detail row using the ASPxGridViewAdaptivitySettings.AdaptiveDetailColumnCount property. If the ASPxGridViewAdaptivitySettings.AllowOnlyOneAdaptiveDetailExpanded property is set to true, expanding an adaptive detail row collapses the previously expanded row. Note that the group footer, total footer, header, and filter cells are not displayed for hidden columns in responsive mode. NoteView the Demo To see this mode in action, refer to the Responsive Layout online demo.

To export grid data, assign its ID to the ASPxGridViewExporter.GridViewID property and select the export method. For example, to export data to a file in the XLS format, use the ASPxGridExporterBase.WriteXlsToResponse method. Use the ASPxGridViewDetailSettings.ExportMode property to specify detail rows for exporting. For instance, set this property to Expanded to export only master rows and expanded detail rows. You can customize the appearance of exported grid elements using the ASPxGridViewExporter.Styles property. NoteThe ASPxGridViewExporter cannot export hidden data columns and the content of templates. The exception is the BootstrapGridView control within the GridViewTemplates.DetailRow template. ASPxGridViewExporter can identify the grid within this type of a template, and allows both master and detail data to be exported. Note that templated elements are exported with their default representation. For instance, if you export a grid with templated cells, they are represented as default labels with text in the obtained file. Excel Data Aware Export When exporting data in both XLS and XLSX formats, the following grid data are maintained in the resulting excel document. Data grouping - with the capability to collapse/expand groups within a worksheet. Data sorting and filtering - allowing end-users to display relevant data in the desired order.

For example, you can display the number of records or the maximum value. The Bootstrap Card View supports total summaries that are calculated over all the cards and are displayed within the Summary Panel. Summaries are represented by ASPxSummaryItem objects. To work properly, the following two summary item properties must be specified. The ASPxSummaryItemBase.FieldName property specifies the name of the data source field in which values are used for summary calculation. The ASPxSummaryItemBase.SummaryType property specifies the aggregate function type. ASPX <dx:ASPxSummaryItem FieldName=\"Total\" SummaryType=\"Sum\"/> The summary item above summarizes the ‘Total’ field values within cards and displays the sum in the summary panel. NoteIn server mode, a summary cannot be calculated for unbound columns in which values are calculated using events (see BootstrapCardView.CustomUnboundColumnData). Only columns with unbound expressions (see CardViewColumn.UnboundExpression) support summary calculation. Example: Creating Total Summaries in Code This example shows how to calculate the average price and display it in the Card View’s summary panel: C# ASPxCardViewSummaryItem totalSummary = new ASPxCardViewSummaryItem(); totalSummary.FieldName = \"UnitPrice\"; totalSummary.SummaryType = DevExpress.Data.SummaryItemType.Average; CardView1.TotalSummary.Add(totalSummary); See Also Online Demo: Summary","codeBlocks":["<dx:ASPxSummaryItem FieldName=\"Total\" SummaryType=\"Sum\"/>","ASPxCardViewSummaryItem totalSummary = new ASPxCardViewSummaryItem();\ntotalSummary.FieldName = \"UnitPrice\";\ntotalSummary.SummaryType = DevExpress.Data.SummaryItemType.Average;\nCardView1.TotalSummary.Add(totalSummary);"],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:28:42.209Z"},{"id":"8ldx4v","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/119560/card-view/filtering","title":"Filtering | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Search: Search Search in… DevExpress documentation only All DevExpress web resources Docs > Card View > Filtering All docs V25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Filter table of contents Clear search input Full-text search ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls Overview Getting Started Demos and Sample Applications Project Configuration Security Considerations Grid View Card View Binding to Data Columns Data Summaries Filtering Header Filter Search Panel Sorting Data Editing Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager Redistribution and Deployment .NET Framework API Reference Client API Reference Download CHM Filtering Apr 01, 2018 Overview Filtering allows you to display a subset of records that meet certain criteria in the data source.

To enable the sorting feature, set the column’s GridDataColumnSettings.AllowSort property to True. If this property is set to Default, the column’s behavior is controlled by the Card View’s ASPxGridBehaviorSettings.AllowSort option. NoteBy default, the CardView does not sort a column if its data items do not implement the IComparable interface. To sort such columns, you can do one of the following. Manually implement the IComparable interface for column data items. Implement custom column sorting. For this purpose, set the column’s GridDataColumnSettings.AllowSort property to true, set the GridDataColumnSettings.SortMode property to Custom, and implement a custom sorting algorithm within the BootstrapCardView.CustomColumnSort event handler. Sorting at Runtime End-users can sort data against a data column or change a column’s sort order by clicking its header. A column’s current sort order is indicated by the sort glyph displayed at the column header’s right edge. If the column isn’t sorted, the sort glyph is hidden. If sorting isn’t applied, clicking a column’s header sorts data by its values in ascending order. If sorting is already applied to a column, subsequent clicks reverse the current sort order. A regular click on a column header clears the sort settings on other columns. To preserve the existing sort settings of other columns, hold the SHIFT key down while clicking. This can be useful when sorting against multiple columns. To clear a column’s sorting, click its header while pressing the CTRL key. Sorting in Code Server To apply sorting to a column(s), use one of the following methods. Set the column’s CardViewColumn.SortOrder property to ColumnSortOrder.Ascending or ColumnSortOrder.Descending. Call the column’s CardViewColumn.SortAscending or CardViewColumn.SortDescending method. Call the Bootstrap Card View’s ASPxClientCardView.SortBy method. The following sample code sorts data against the Contact Name column in ascending order.

The Edit Form displays edit cells corresponding to a data column, and allows the values within this card to be changed. Popup Edit Form The Bootstrap Card View displays the Popup Edit Form in edit mode. Batch The Bootstrap Card View maintains all user changes on the client side until the Save changes link (the Update command) is clicked, or all changes are canceled by clicking the Cancel changes link (the Cancel command). To learn more, see Batch Edit Mode. End-users can switch the Bootstrap Card View to an edit mode by clicking the Edit command. Or use the ASPxCardView.StartEdit method to switch to an edit mode in code. To switch the Bootstrap Card View back to browse mode and save all changes made, click the Update command or use the ASPxCardView.UpdateEdit method. To discard the changes, click the Cancel command or call the ASPxCardView.CancelEdit method. You can prevent data editing, deleting and inserting by using the BootstrapCardViewDataSecuritySettings.AllowDelete, BootstrapCardViewDataSecuritySettings.AllowDelete and BootstrapCardViewDataSecuritySettings.AllowInsert properties, respectively.

A plan could contain the appointment’s subject, location, different marks (status and labels), comments and any other custom properties. A single appointment is an object that exposes the Appointment interface. The appointment’s appearance depends upon the active view (ASPxScheduler.ActiveView) which is used to show the Scheduler’s data. For instance, for the Day View a common appointment usually looks as shown in the image below. All of a scheduler’s appointments are stored in the BootstrapAppointmentStorage (which is a part of the Scheduler Storage and is accessed via its BootstrapSchedulerStorage.Appointments property). The collection of all the appointments is accessed via the AppointmentStorageBase.Items property. Labels and Statuses An appointment’s identification label and availability status are an appointment’s basic visual characteristics. They are used for at-a-glance appointment identification. An identification label is displayed in as a background color which is used to fill the client region of the rectangle that is occupied by the appointment. An individual label is represented by the BootstrapAppointmentLabel objects. The label’s display name and color can be accessed using its BootstrapAppointmentLabel.Text and AppointmentLabel.Color properties, and all the labels are stored in the BootstrapAppointmentStorage.Labels collection. The availability status is indicated by a strip displayed on the left side of the appointment. The strip is colored depending upon the availability status’s type. An individual status is represented by the BootstrapAppointmentStatus objects.

There are different kinds of resources, and the decision as to what should be a resource in a particular scheduling application depends upon the specifics of the task solved by the application. Here are some examples of scheduling tasks, illustrating what can be an appointment and a resource in these examples. A Business. Resource: Every employee in this company. Appointment: Any time interval spent by an employee, to perform a particular task. A Car Rental Agency. Resource: Every car which is owned by this firm, and can be leased. Appointment: Any time interval when any of the firm’s cars are leased. An Educational Center. Resources: Every teacher who works at this center, or every room in this center. Appointment: Any time interval when any of the teachers is delivering a lecture in any of the rooms at the center. NoteIn the latter example, two kinds or resources are possible (teachers and rooms). However, the Bootstrap Scheduler doesn’t allow appointments to belong to resources of different types. So, to display this data in a scheduling application, we suggest using two pages with different Scheduler Controls. An appointment can have one or several resources assigned to it. If it has no resources assigned, then it is assumed that any resource can be associated with that appointment. Assigning Appointments to Resources A single resource is an object that exposes the Resource interface. All of scheduler’s resources are stored in the ASPxResourceStorage (which is a part of the Scheduler Storage and is accessed via its ASPxSchedulerStorage.Resources property).

These views define the time intervals (for instance, the Day view displays only one or several days at a time), the user interface elements, and the control’s behavior specific to the currently active view. This view plays a major part in the Scheduler control’s appearance. The following view types are supported: Agenda View Day View Work-Week View Full Week View Week View Month View Timeline View Agenda View NoteOnline Demo To see the Agenda View in action, view the following demo online: Agenda View The Agenda View displays a chronological list of appointments, grouped by a day.

A template is a set of HTML elements and Web controls that define an element’s layout within the control (for example, a resource header). When the control runs on an ASP.NET Web page, the template’s contents are rendered instead of the control’s default HTML. The picture below illustrates a sample template applied to Scheduler: These image-based resource headers are implemented using templates. NoteYou can use your scripts in custom templates. For this purpose, add the “dxss_” prefix to the script block’s ID. Such scripts are automatically merged with the JavaScript code inserted in the page to which the template is rendered, and therefore are available on the client side.

Time zone information is used to calculate start and end times for an appointment if the time zone of the web server (where the server part of the Scheduler operates) is different form the time zone in which the Scheduler’s client scripts are executed. Time zone calculations are illustrated in the picture below. You can find a detailed explanation of the Bootstrap Scheduler’s time zones in the text that follows the picture. Server Time Zone The Scheduler control’s server part obtains time zone information from the time zone of the web server where the APS.NET application runs. It defaults to the time zone of the server OS. You can specify time zone explicitly for your application by using the SchedulerStorageBase.TimeZoneId property. When the DateTime data are retrieved or stored from/to the data source, time zone conversions are not performed. In the picture illustrating the time zone calculation you can see that 1 PM in the database is interpreted as 1 PM Pacific Standard Time and translated to 4 PM for the Eastern Time Zone. Client Time Zone By default, the client time zone is assumed to be the same as the server time zone. The client time zone is the time zone in which the Scheduler’s client scripts operate. User will see views, appointments and appointment dialogs displaying data translated to the Client Time Zone. In the picture above the client time zone is Eastern Time, and an appointment with a start time of 1 PM is displayed as if it starts at 4 PM. The difference is 3 hours, which corresponds to the difference between Los Angeles (server-side) and New York (client-side). The SchedulerOptionsBehaviorBase.ClientTimeZoneId property is used to specify the client time zone. It can be accessed via the ASPxScheduler.OptionsBehavior.ClientTimeZoneId notation. You can specify a ClientTimeZoneId v","codeBlocks":[],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:28:47.105Z"},{"id":"pwtfhk","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/120504/scheduler/export-and-import","title":"Export and Import | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 The page you are viewing does not exist in version 18.1. 17.2 The page you are viewing does not exist in version 17.2.

It involves creating a report which is based on Scheduler information, or represents one of the Scheduler views. Then, standard methods for constructing and printing the report may be utilized to obtain the desired printout. This approach is aimed at providing extreme flexibility in constructing print styles for the Scheduler data. Printing via Reports Report Controls Can Shrink and Can Grow Features SmartSync Feature Printing via Reports This document describes a technique of creating an XtraSchedulerReport which can be used to compose a printable document, based on the Scheduler information, or representing one of the Scheduler views. This approach is aimed at providing extreme flexibility in constructing print styles for the Scheduler data. It utilizes the XtraReports Suite to create a report containing controls specially designed to represent Scheduler entities. This report is an object of the XtraSchedulerReport class, which is a descendant of the XtraReport class, offering many useful features available in XtraReports. The report retrieves scheduler data via the print adapter. The main purpose of the print adapter is to compose a data set used in the report. In order to filter the Scheduler data, the print adapter provides a set of validation events. There are two print adapter types - the ASPxSchedulerStoragePrintAdapter and ASPxSchedulerControlPrintAdapter. For example, you can handle the ASPxSchedulerPrintAdapterBase.ValidateAppointments event, to print appointments which meet specific criteria. The next level of data representation is the report view. It is like the view which exists in the Scheduler, so there are ReportDayView, ReportWeekView and ReportTime","codeBlocks":[],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:28:47.989Z"},{"id":"2x3vsn","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/400671/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-features","title":"Features | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 The page you are viewing does not exist in version 18.1. 17.2 The page you are viewing does not exist in version 17.2.

Server-Side API On the server side, the Rich Text Editor control is represented by the BootstrapRichEdit class. To load the document using server-side API, specify the working directory path using the WorkDirectory property and then call the Open method to load the document into the control. ASPX C# <dx:BootstrapRichEdit runat=\"server\" ID=\"RichEdit\" Height=\"500px\"> </dx:BootstrapRichEdit> protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if(!IsPostBack) RichEdit.Open(Server.MapPath(\"~/App_Data/Documents/Overview.rtf\")); } NoteThe BootstrapRichEdit control internally uses a comprehensive server-side API (a set of interfaces, methods, events, and commands) implemented by the RichEdit Core Library to access the document from code. This API is not publicly exposed at the BootstrapRichEdit control level. If you want to get familiarized with the RichEdit document’s internal implementation, however, you can refer to the Document Server’s Fundamentals - Document topic, which lists the most important entities of the RichEdit API. Client-Side API The Rich Text Editor’s client API is available through the BootstrapClientRichEdit class. It provides information about the current settings of the main document model elements and allows you to modify selected element settings. ASPxClientRichEdit.document Provides access to structures allowing you to obtain the current information about certain document structural elements. ASPxClientRichEdit.selection Provides access to a set of methods and properties allowing you to position the cursor within a document and to select document content elements.

The most important characteristic of a series is its type, which determines a particular visual representation of data. You can access the chart series’ collection using the chart’s SeriesCollection property. Use this property to specify settings of an individual series. ASPX <dx:BootstrapChart ID=\"BootstrapChart1\" runat=\"server\" ... > <SeriesCollection> <dx:BootstrapChartSeries Type=\"Area\" ValueField=\"y1564\" Name=\"15-64 years\" ... /> </SeriesCollection> ... </dx:BootstrapChart> You can also specify particular options to be common for all series using the chart’s SettingsCommonSeries property. ASPX <dx:BootstrapChart ID=\"BootstrapChart1\" runat=\"server\" ... > <SettingsCommonSeries Type=\"Area\" ... > ... </dx:BootstrapChart> All specified series use the same value axis by default. However, you can plot series with different value axes in one pane as well. For this purpose, define the value axes and specify the BootstrapChartSeriesBase.Axis property for each series. ASPX <dx:BootstrapChart ID=\"BootstrapChart1\" runat=\"server\" ...> <SeriesCollection> <dx:BootstrapChartSeries Type=\"Line\" Axis=\"mainAxis\" ... /> <dx:BootstrapChartSeries Type=\"Bar\" Axis=\"secondaryAxis\" ... /> </SeriesCollection> <ValueAxisCollection> <dx:BootstrapChartValueAxis Name=\"mainAxis\" /> <dx:BootstrapChartValueAxis Name=\"secondaryAxis\" /> </ValueAxisCollection> ... </dx:BootstrapChart> See Also Chart Series Types Pie Chart Series Types Polar Chart Series Types","codeBlocks":["<dx:BootstrapChart ID=\"BootstrapChart1\" runat=\"server\" ... >\n    <SeriesCollection>\n        <dx:BootstrapChartSeries Type=\"Area\" ValueField=\"y1564\" Name=\"15-64 years\"  ... />\n    </SeriesCollection> \n    ...\n</dx:BootstrapChart>","<dx:BootstrapChart ID=\"BootstrapChart1\" runat=\"server\" ... >\n    <SettingsCommonSeries Type=\"Area\" ... >\n    ...\n</dx:BootstrapChart>","<dx:BootstrapChart ID=\"BootstrapChart1\" runat=\"server\" ...>\n    <SeriesCollection>\n        <dx:BootstrapChartSeries Type=\"Line\" Axis=\"mainAxis\" ... />\n        <dx:BootstrapChartSeries Type=\"Bar\" Axis=\"secondaryAxis\" ... /> \n    </SeriesCollection>\n\n    <ValueAxisCollection>\n        <dx:BootstrapChartValueAxis Name=\"mainAxis\" />\n        <dx:BootstrapChartValueAxis Name=\"secondaryAxis\" />\n    </ValueAxisCollection>\n    ...\n</dx:BootstrapChart>"],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:28:52.984Z"},{"id":"k42xo6","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/118714/charts/binding-to-data","title":"Binding to Data | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Search: Search Search in… DevExpress documentation only All DevExpress web resources Docs > Charts > Binding to Data All docs V25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Filter table of contents Clear search input Full-text search ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls Overview Getting Started Demos and Sample Applications Project Configuration Security Considerations Grid View Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Get Started Chart Types Chart Series Binding to Data Server Functionality Export Zooming and Scrolling Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager Redistribution and Deployment .NET Framework API Reference Client API Reference Download CHM Binding to Data Jul 13, 2021 2 minutes to read This document provides information on data binding approaches supported by chart controls included into the DevExpress Bootstrap Charts suite. The following approaches are supported: Data Source Controls JSON Files JSONP Data Source Controls The chart controls can obtain data from one of the ASP.NET data source controls (such as EntityDataSource) on the server side. Use this to provide large amounts of data from the database to the widget, and if you do not need to get data from third-party sources. To assign a data source to a chart, set the chart’s BootstrapWebClientUIWidget.DataSourceID property. ASPX <dx:BootstrapPieChart runat=\"server\" DataSourceID=\"DataSource1\" TitleText=\"Meat/Poultry Sales\"> <SeriesCollection> <dx:BootstrapPieChartSeries ArgumentField=\"ProductName\" ValueField=\"ProductSales\"> </dx:BootstrapPieChartSeries> </SeriesCollection> </dx:BootstrapPieChart> <ef:EntityDataSource runat=\"server\" ID=\"DataSource1\" ContextTypeName=\"MyWebApplication.NorthwindContext\" EntitySetName=\"SalesByCategory\" Select=\"it.[ProductName], it.[ProductSales]\" Where=\"it.[CategoryName] = 'Meat/Poultry'\"> </ef:EntityDataSource> For testing purposes, you can use demo databases supplied with DevExpress Bootstrap components. The databases are installed in the following folder, by default: C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\DevExpress Demos 25.2\\Components\\ASP.NET\\CS\\BootstrapDemos\\App_Data\\ JSON Files Performing AJAX requests is inevitable if your server stores data in JSON. However, instead of configuring these requests manually, you can assign the URL of your data storage to the BootstrapWebClientUIWidget.DataSourceUrl property and the chart control automatically performs the requests required to obtain data from the storage. The URL can specify an absolute or relative path to the resource.

To invoke the designer, select a chart control, click its smart tag and select Designer in the invoked menu. The designer includes sections allowing you to manage collections of chart series and value axes. Each collection item can be individually configured using the Item Properties panel. After you close the Chart Designer by clicking OK, the chart’s ASPX markup reflects all changes made in the designer.","codeBlocks":["<dx:BootstrapChart runat=\"server\" DataSourceUrl=\"~/jsondata/data.json\" TitleText=\"Daily Sales\" Rotated=\"true\">\n    <ArgumentAxis ArgumentType=\"System.DateTime\" MaxValue=\"2017-01-10\" />\n    <ValueAxisCollection>\n        <dx:BootstrapChartValueAxis TickInterval=\"1\" />\n    </ValueAxisCollection>\n    <SeriesCollection>\n        <dx:BootstrapChartSeries ArgumentField=\"date\" ValueField=\"sales\" Type=\"Bar\" />\n    </SeriesCollection>\n    <SettingsLegend Visible=\"false\" />\n</dx:BootstrapChart>"],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:28:53.860Z"},{"id":"s3391j","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/119314/charts/export","title":"Export | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Search: Search Search in… DevExpress documentation only All DevExpress web resources Docs > Charts > Export All docs V25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Filter table of contents Clear search input Full-text search ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls Overview Getting Started Demos and Sample Applications Project Configuration Security Considerations Grid View Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Get Started Chart Types Chart Series Binding to Data Server Functionality Export Zooming and Scrolling Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager Redistribution and Deployment .NET Framework API Reference Client API Reference Download CHM Export May 24, 2023 Set the BootstrapUIWidgetExportSettings.Enabled property to true to allow users to print or export a chart control’s content.

Features Bootstrap Button provides the following features: Radio Button Functionality It is possible to create a set of mutually exclusive buttons (similar to the functionality found in radio buttons). This can be accomplished by using the ASPxButton.Checked property. To create a mutually exclusive set of buttons, use the ASPxButton.GroupName property to specify a group of button controls. Once the ASPxButton.GroupName property has been set, only one button in the specified group can be checked at one time. When a button’s checked state is changed, the ASPxButton.CheckedChanged event is raised. Built-in Validation The Bootstrap Button control allows you to perform data validation on both the client and server side.

Data-Bound and Unbound Modes Support Editor content can be generated dynamically by binding the editor to a data source, as well as manually populating the control’s item collection. When retrieving items from the data source, item characteristics such as the text, value, and image are obtained from specific data fields. These data fields can be either defined manually using an item’s FieldName property or are obtained automatically, provided that the data fields in the data source are named like the item’s characteristics (Text, ImageURL, Value). Three Item Loading Modes The Bootstrap Combo Box control supports three item loading modes. Loading Mode Description Affected Properties Default All items are loaded to the client side, so all data operations (such as scrolling, filtering) are performed on the client, without generating a round trip to the server. EnableCallbackMode=”False” On-Demand Items are loaded from the server on demand using callbacks. For instance, list items that are not currently displayed within the editor’s dropdown window can be dynamically loaded when an end-user scrolls the list. This callback mode forces the first page load much faster, since only a few items need to be initially loaded. EnableCallbackMode = “True” Dynamic You can manually populate a dropdown list with the required item portions, based on the currently applied filter criteria (the ASPxAutoCompleteBoxBase.IncrementalFilteringMode property value is other then “None”) and the list scrolling performed.

It offers a number of advanced features such as uploading files via AJAX callbacks, built-in validation of the uploaded file against the specified criteria (for instance, the file’s size, extension and mime types), an enhanced client-side API and others. This topic lists the features that are unique to the Upload Control. Control Features Upload of the specified client file is initiated automatically on the last postback. File upload initiated by the Upload button or the ASPxClientUploadControl.Upload client method is performed using the AJAX callback technology, which improves the web application’s performance. The control can work in either of two upload modes provided (Standard or Advanced). In the Standard Mode, the uploaded file is sent to the server in one request and is cached in its entirety in server memory. In the Advanced Mode, the uploaded file is sent to the server in small packets (one by one) and is saved into a temporary file within a specific server folder. See Upload Modes to learn more. The uploaded file can be automatically validated on the server, based upon a number of settings defined via the ASPxUploadControl.ValidationSettings property. If the validation fails, a descriptive error message is displayed within the ASPxUploadControl’s error form, informing an end-user about the reason for the error. Developers are able to implement any custom validation logic and save the uploaded file, if it’s valid, by handling a single BootstrapButtonEdit.ValidationSettings server event. Efficient facilities are provided to access the uploaded file’s content and save the file to a specific location on the server.

Like other DevExpress web controls, building standard menus for your web application is not the only thing you can deliver with this suite. With integrated template technology, you can easily transform menu items into anything you can imagine. For instance, you can transform a single-item menu into a popup entry form. This topic lists the features that are unique to the Bootstrap Menu Control. Control Features You can bind a menu to a data source so that your menu structure is retrieved from an XML file or a database table. Templates can be specified for root-level items, sub-menu items or for each item individually. A menu control allows you to visually indicate selected items. Client-Side Features You can use client-side events to perform custom actions when a sub-menu is being invoked or hidden, and when end-users click a menu item. The client-side API allows you to traverse through the entire menu structure and obtain each and every item’s settings. Root-level Menu Features Horizontal or vertical layout can be used for the root level. This means you can build menus that open sideways as well as main menus. Sub-menus You can customize how fast a sub-menu appears or closes after end-user selection. A menu control automatically adjusts the sub-menu position so that sub-menus are completely visible within the browser window, when possible. Parent menu items can display small glyphs that indicate the presence of sub-menus. By default, such glyphs are displayed in all parent items except for those at the root level. You can enable sub-menu glyphs at the root level or make them invisible in all items. Sub menus can display a side strip (gutter) with customizable size and appearance. Separators You may wish to display separators between each neighboring menu item pair in the entire menu, or only between items at the root level.

With Bootstrap Tree View, you can manually create a tree or easily populate it with data by binding to hierarchical data sources, including XmlDataSource and SiteMapDataSource. You can also operate in Virtual Mode to efficiently use your server resources when working with complex or dynamically created hierarchies. The Tree View control is highly customizable: you can change the appearance of almost any visual elements. With integrated template technology, you can easily transform nodes into anything you can imagine. This topic lists the main features of the Tree View control. Control Features Tree View can be populated with node information taken from a data source containing hierarchical data, including SiteMapDataSource and XmlDataSource. Tree View can operate in Virtual Mode, which greatly reduces both the server load and start-up time when working with complex or dynamically created hierarchies. Templates can be specified for two element types: node text content and the entire node content. You can apply templates for all identical elements within Tree View (using control level templates) or for a particular element (using node level templates). AJAX Support You can enable AJAX support by setting the ASPxTreeList.EnableCallbacks property to true. In this case, Tree View initially loads only the content of expanded nodes onto the client. When end-users expand nodes, their content is loaded via callbacks. Once a node’s content has been loaded, end-users can switch to this node on the client-side without callbacks or postbacks.

The collection of the Callback Panel’s child controls can be accessed via the ASPxPanelContainerBase.Controls property. The Callback Panel control implements a comprehensive client-side, and server-side functionality that enables updating its content on demand via callbacks. The client-side object model contains the client object for the Callback Panel control (BootstrapClientCallbackPanel), its method required to send a callback to the server (BootstrapClientCallbackPanel.PerformCallback), and methods allowing specific client operations to be performed when a callback sends to and comes from the server side (BootstrapClientCallbackPanel.BeginCallback and BootstrapClientCallbackPanel.EndCallback). Use the control’s BootstrapCallbackPanel.ClientSideEvents property to assign a handler for the available client-side events. An instance of the BootstrapClientCallbackPanel object can be easily identified on the client by using the client programmatic identifier set via the ASPxPanelBase.ClientInstanceName property. The required server-side processing of a callback sent from the client side by using the BootstrapClientCallbackPanel.PerformCallback method can be performed in a handler of the control’s server-side BootstrapCallbackPanel.Callback event. The code sample below demonstrates the use of the Bootstrap Callback Panel.

You can add layout group containers as children to the BootstrapFormLayout. A layout group container allows you to arrange its items side-by-side (either vertically or horizontally) or as tabs This topic lists the main features of the BootstrapFormLayout control. Control Features Automatic alignment of controls that are nested into the Form Layout layout items. These controls are automatically aligned against the left edges according to their associated labels. Rendering into Bootstrap grid system markup. The Form Layout control utilizes common approaches to constructing adaptive web interfaces using Bootstrap to seamlessly integrate with Bootstrap-powered page layouts. Groups can be rendered as tab containers or group box containers. Layout support for third party controls. You have the capability to nest any control you like into the layout item.

Each page in the Page Control serves as a separate child control container allowing you to associate specific page content with each displayed tab. The Page Control offers you an extremely flexible means to control end-user interaction. Numerous server-side settings, client-side API and events allow you to take full control over how your tab control responds to user actions. You have complete control over what user action activates a tab, and whether there should be a postback, callback or client processing. Note that the most frequently used scenarios are already built-in - you just need to toggle a property. This topic lists the features that are unique to the web controls from the Page Contro. Control Features Templates can be specified for tabs in both active and inactive states, and for each tab individually. AJAX Support The Page Control can obtain page contents from the server using AJAX requests when an end-user switches tabs. When this feature is enabled, only the content of the active page is sent to the client during the first request. Client-Side Features Client-side events allow you to perform custom actions when an end-user clicks on a tab, and immediately after the corresponding page has been loaded. If you use AJAX functionality, you will need these events to indicate that a callback is in progress. You can use the client-side API to activate tabs, obtain tab information and specify HTML content for pages. Tab Features A convenient tab collection design-time editor is available. Customizable tab spacing. Tab position and alignment can be changed to display tabs at any edge and corner of the Page Control. You can specify tooltips for tabs.

Popup windows are temporarily overlapping windows that appear separately from an application’s main window and are used to display quick reference information. This topic lists the features that are unique to the Bootstrap Popup Control. Control Features Automatically invoke a popup window on page load, without requiring any user action (for example, a button click). Clicking, right-clicking or hot-tracking an HTML element (for example, a button) invokes a popup window. Select from three end-user actions to close the popup window. These actions include: clicking outside the window, moving the mouse pointer away from the element that was previously hot-tracked to make the window visible, and clicking the window’s “close” button. The time delay before showing or hiding a popup window can be customized. Note that a time delay is only in effect when hot-tracking an HTML element invokes a popup window. Specify how a popup window is aligned relative to the HTML source element. You can align a popup window’s horizontal (or vertical) border to any horizontal (or vertical) border of an HTML element, or center it. You can specify the horizontal and vertical offsets in pixels if these alignment options are insufficient. Customizable header and footer content. Headers and footers in the popup window allow you to display a glyph and caption text (or a hyperlink). Note that you can also use templates for more flexible header and footer content customization. Client-Side Features The control’s client-side equivalent is represented by the BootstrapClientPopupControl object. Client-side events allow you to respond to changes in a popup window’s visibility state. You can use client-side API to show and hide popup windows, specify their position relative to other HTML elements and change their content.

The way you communicate with a data source determines how efficiently your application runs and how well it scales. There is no data access strategy that is suitable for all situations. In fact, each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common way of accessing data in Web Forms pages is to retrieve it from a database using a data source control. To bind the Grid View to a data source, invoke its tasks and select an existing data source (if any) from the list, or create a new one. For testing purposes, you can use demo databases supplied with DevExpress Bootstrap components. The databases are installed in the following folder, by default: C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\DevExpress Demos 25.2\\Components\\ASP.NET\\CS\\BootstrapDemos\\App_Data\\ After the Grid View has been bound to a data source, it is suggested that you disable its ASPxGridView.AutoGenerateColumns option and create columns for all the fields in the bound data source. Any existing columns are deleted first. New columns will be created in the same order in which bound fields appear in the data source. Finally, you should set the ASPxGridBase.KeyFieldName property to the name of the data source key field. The following sample code shows how the Grid View can be connected to a data source in code. C# VB.NET gridView.DataSource = SqlDataSource1; gridView.KeyFieldName = \"ID\"; gridView.DataBind(); gridView.DataSource = SqlDataSource1 gridView.KeyFieldName = \"ID\" gridView.DataBind()","codeBlocks":["gridView.DataSource = SqlDataSource1;\ngridView.KeyFieldName = \"ID\";\ngridView.DataBind();","gridView.DataSource = SqlDataSource1\ngridView.KeyFieldName = \"ID\"\ngridView.DataBind()"],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:29:22.191Z"},{"id":"jrzrrf","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/117697/grid-view/binding-to-data/binding-to-large-data-database-server-mode","title":"Binding to Large Data (Database Server Mode) | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Search: Search Search in… DevExpress documentation only All DevExpress web resources Docs > Grid View > Binding to Data > Binding to Large Data (Database Server Mode) All docs V25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Filter table of contents Clear search input Full-text search ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls Overview Getting Started Demos and Sample Applications Project Configuration Security Considerations Grid View Binding to Data Connecting Bootstrap Grid View to a Data Source Binding to Large Data (Database Server Mode) Data Binding to Large Data via EF Data Binding to Large Data via LINQ Data Binding to Large Data via XPO Database Server Mode Limitations Built-in Row Cache Data Representation Basics Data Summaries Filtering Grouping Sorting Cell Merging Focus and Navigation Data Editing Master-Detail Relationship Adaptivity Templates Export Data-Toggle Attribute Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager Redistribution and Deployment .NET Framework API Reference Client API Reference Download CHM Binding to Large Data (Database Server Mode) May 15, 2018 2 minutes to read The Bootstrap Grid View control supports a specific binding mode designed to work with large datasets. Within this binding mode, data-aware operations (sorting, grouping, etc.) are performed on the database server side, which is why this mode is called database server mode. Database Server Mode vs. Regular Binding Mode In server mode, the Bootstrap Grid View is bound to data via one of the following components that provides data : LinqServerModeDataSource, EntityServerModeDataSource or XpoDataSource. When an end-user performs data operations (sorting, grouping, etc.), a component providing data analyzes the grid’s current state and generates smart queries to receive only those records that must be displayed on screen. These requests are passed to the associated queryable source. The queryable source translates these requests into the required queries and executes them. This ensures a quick response and improved performance for large data sources. In regular data binding mode, before it’s displayed within a grid control, data must be fetched in its entirety from a data store into memory. The number of records is a bottleneck, as the more records there are, the more time is required to load the data. Moreover, the grid’s performance also depends on the total number of loaded records, particularly when data is sorted, grouped, filtered or the summary feature is used. In this case, the grid needs to process the entire recordset to implement a specific data-aware operation. For end-users, the Grid View functions identically in regular and server modes.

Row Cache Life Cycle Grid View copies field values of visible and invisible columns to an internal data collection contained in a hidden field. A page sends the hidden field values to the server with postback and callback data. On the server, this data is deserialized. When Grid View requires row data, the control attempts to load that data from the row cache. If all required rows are available in the cache, Grid View does not send a query to the database. Since the row cache contains only visible row data, this mechanism is effective exclusively if a row list on the current page does not change. For example, the row cache is particularly useful in the following scenarios when: A user selects, focuses a row, or moves a column on the current page. Another page control initiates a page request. In this case, Grid View data does not change unless Grid View is modified on the server side during this request. Sort, filter, and page operations cause new rows to appear on a page. Row cache does not have data for new rows and Grid View sends a query to the database to obtain necessary data. Methods That Can Force Data Binding GetRowValues(Int32, String[]) | Find...TemplateControl These methods return row values. When you call these methods, Grid View searches for a value in the row cache. If the required row data is found, data binding does not occur. Grid View binds to a data source if the row cache is disabled or has no required data. GetRow(Int32) | GetDataRow(Int32) These methods return a row data object rather than row values.

These cell types are described in this document. Data Cells The Bootstrap Grid View displays data using data columns and rows. Each data row displays data cells. Each data cell value corresponds to a field value within a record. Data cells are at the intersection of data column and data rows. To identify a cell when obtaining its value, you need to know its parent row and column. A data row is identified by its visible position (index) within the Bootstrap Grid View. A data column is identified by its ID, caption or the name of the data source field to which it is bound. The following sample code obtains the department displayed within the first visible row and its budget. C# object cellValues = BootstrapGridView1.GetRowValues(0, new string[] {\"Department\", \"Budget\"}); Edit Cells Edit cells are displayed within the Edit Form when the Bootstrap Grid View is in an edit mode. They correspond to data columns and allow their values within the edited row to be changed. An edit cell displays the name of the column to which it corresponds, as well as the editor that is used to edit column values. The editor displayed within the edit cell is specified by the column’s GridViewDataColumn.PropertiesEdit property.

Total summaries are displayed in footer cells, provided that the ASPxGridViewSettings.ShowFooter option is enabled. ASPxSummaryItem objects represent total summaries. The Bootstrap Grid View stores its total summaries within the ASPxGridView.TotalSummary collection. You can use the BootstrapGridView Designer as shown above to manage this collection at design time. The ASPxSummaryItem.ShowInColumn property allows you to specify which column should display a summary value in the footer cell. The summary is displayed in a column specified via the ASPxSummaryItemBase.FieldName property if the ShowInColumn property is not specified. Use the ASPxGridView.GetTotalSummaryValue and ASPxSummaryItem.GetTotalFooterDisplayText methods to obtain a total summary value and its text representation, respectively. Example: Creating Total Summaries in Code The following example shows how to calculate the average budget and display it in the Bootstrap Grid View’s footer: C# VB.NET ASPxSummaryItem totalSummary = new ASPxSummaryItem(); totalSummary.FieldName = \"Budget\"; totalSummary.ShowInColumn = \"Budget\"; totalSummary.SummaryType = SummaryItemType.Average; BootstrapGridView1.TotalSummary.Add(totalSummary); Dim totalSummary As ASPxSummaryItem = New ASPxSummaryItem() totalSummary.FieldName = \"Budget\" totalSummary.ShowInColumn = \"Budget\" totalSummary.SummaryType = SummaryItemType.Average BootstrapGridView1.TotalSummary.Add(totalSummary)","codeBlocks":["ASPxSummaryItem totalSummary = new ASPxSummaryItem();\ntotalSummary.FieldName = \"Budget\";\ntotalSummary.ShowInColumn = \"Budget\";\ntotalSummary.SummaryType = SummaryItemType.Average;\nBootstrapGridView1.TotalSummary.Add(totalSummary);","Dim totalSummary As ASPxSummaryItem = New ASPxSummaryItem()\ntotalSummary.FieldName = \"Budget\"\ntotalSummary.ShowInColumn = \"Budget\"\ntotalSummary.SummaryType = SummaryItemType.Average\nBootstrapGridView1.TotalSummary.Add(totalSummary)"],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:29:24.838Z"},{"id":"mzhtvi","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/117789/grid-view/data-summaries/group-summary","title":"Group Summary | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Search: Search Search in… DevExpress documentation only All DevExpress web resources Docs > Grid View > Data Summaries > Group Summary All docs V25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Filter table of contents Clear search input Full-text search ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls Overview Getting Started Demos and Sample Applications Project Configuration Security Considerations Grid View Binding to Data Data Representation Basics Data Summaries Total Summary Group Summary Create Custom Summaries Filtering Grouping Sorting Cell Merging Focus and Navigation Data Editing Master-Detail Relationship Adaptivity Templates Export Data-Toggle Attribute Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager Redistribution and Deployment .NET Framework API Reference Client API Reference Download CHM Group Summary Nov 14, 2018 2 minutes to read The group summary represents the value of the aggregate function calculated over all data rows within a group. Group summaries are displayed within group rows or group footer cells. Group summaries are represented by the ASPxSummaryItem objects. Bootstrap Grid View stores its group summaries within the ASPxGridView.GroupSummary collection. To manage this collection at design time, you can use the Edit Form as shown above. The ASPxSummaryItem object provides two properties allowing you to determine the location to display the summary. The ASPxSummaryItem.ShowInColumn property specifies the column in which the group row or group footer should display a summary value. The ASPxSummaryItem.ShowInGroupFooterColumn property specifies the column in which cells should display a summary value. To obtain group summary values, use the following methods. Method Description ASPxGridView.GetGroupRowSummaryText Returns the summary text displayed within the specified group row. ASPxGridView.GetGroupSummaryValue Returns a summary value calculated against the specified group of rows. ASPxSummaryItem.GetGroupRowDisplayText Formats the specified value according to the current group row summary item’s format settings. ASPxGridViewSettings.ShowGroupFooter Specifies the ASPxGridView group footers visibility.

These functions allow you to calculate the number of rows, the maximum and minimum values, the sum and the average value. If you need to calculate a summary value using an aggregate function not included in the predefined set, set the summary item’s ASPxSummaryItemBase.SummaryType property to Custom and handle the Grid View control’s ASPxGridBase.CustomSummaryCalculate event. The ASPxGridBase.CustomSummaryCalculate event fires for each row involved in summary calculation. Take into account the difference between calculating the total and group summary values: When calculating a total summary value, the event is raised for each data row in the grid. When calculating a group summary value, the event fires for each data row within the currently processed group. Additionally, the event is raised before and after processing rows, which can be used to perform any initialization and finalization. Example This example shows how to implement a custom summary calculation. Create a summary item within the ASPxGridView.TotalSummary collection, and customize its settings, as shown below: ASPX <TotalSummary> <dx:ASPxSummaryItem FieldName=\"UnitsInStock\" ShowInColumn=\"Units In Stock\" SummaryType=\"Custom\" /> </TotalSummary> Handle the ASPxGridBase.CustomSummaryCalculate event to perform custom calculations in the code-behind. This example demonstrates how to calculate a summary only for selected rows. Note that in order to process selection changes on the server side, you can either set the ASPxGridBehaviorSettings.ProcessSelectionChangedOnServer property to true or handle the ASPxClientGridView.SelectionChanged client event, and call the ASPxClientGridView.PerformCallback client method.

Bound columns obtain their data from a control’s data source. Unbound columns are not bound to any field in a data source. These columns can be populated manually by handling the ASPxGridView.CustomUnboundColumnData event or by specifying an expression using the GridViewDataColumn.UnboundExpression used to evaluate values for this field. The Expressions section describes the syntax for creating expressions. There is no difference between working with bound and unbound columns. You can sort, group, display summaries and filter unbound columns in the same manner as bound columns. An unbound column meets the following requirements. Its GridViewDataColumn.FieldName property must be set to a unique value and not refer to any field in a Grid View’s data source. The column’s GridViewDataColumn.UnboundType property must be set to an appropriate value based on the type of data the column is supposed to display (Boolean, DataTime, Decimal, Integer, String, Object). It shouldn’t be set to UnboundColumnType.Bound. Providing Data for Unbound Columns Data for unbound columns is generally obtained from a custom data source or is calculated based upon the values of bound columns. To allow data editing for an unbound column, its data should be retrieved from a custom data source. When an end-user modifies column data within the Grid View, it should then be saved back to the data source. To provide data for unbound columns and save the changes made by end-users, handle the ASPxGridView.CustomUnboundColumnData event. This event is raised only for unbound columns.

Along with column GridDataColumnSettings.AllowSort and GridViewDataColumnSettings.AllowGroup options set to ‘True’, the ASPxGridViewSettings.ShowGroupPanel property must be set to true. Otherwise, end-users will not be permitted to group data. NoteIf column AllowSort and AllowGroup properties are set to Default, column behavior is controlled by ASPxGridView. In this case, grouping is allowed if the ASPxGridViewBehaviorSettings.AllowGroup and ASPxGridBehaviorSettings.AllowSort options are enabled. When Bootstrap Grid View data is grouped by a single column, data rows that have identical values in this column are arranged into groups. Each group is identified by a group row. Expand the group to access its underlying data rows. If ASPxGridView is grouped by another column, data rows within each group are arranged into second level groups based on the values of the new grouping column. Rows that belong to one group can be displayed on different pages. This occurs when the number of rows contained within a group exceeds the maximum number of rows that can be displayed on a page. The number of columns used to group data is returned by the ASPxGridView.GroupCount property. Data rows are always sorted against grouping columns. If data is grouped against a column which isn’t sorted, ASPxGridView automatically applies sorting in ascending order to the column. To create a custom layout for group rows, create a template and assign it to the GridViewTemplates.GroupRow or GridViewTemplates.GroupRowContent property.

The grouping feature combines rows with identical column values into the same data groups. The Boiotstrap Grid View provides two grouping modes - Interval Grouping and Merged Grouping. NoteGroup modes and custom grouping described in this topic are not supported in server mode. Rows are always grouped by the grouping column values in this mode. Group Modes Interval grouping Interval grouping allows you to change the default grouping logic, especially for columns that contain date/time values. For example, data rows can be arranged by the month or year part of a date/time value, while text columns can be grouped by the first characters. A column’s GridViewDataColumnSettings.GroupInterval property specifies the interval grouping mode. When grouping by date/time values, only the date portion of values is considered, while the time portion is ignored (by default). Rows that contain matching date portions, but different time portions in a grouping column, are combined into a single group. If grouping columns contain other data types, the default grouping logic is used. In this instance, rows are combined into a single group if they have a matching value in a grouping column. Merged grouping Merged grouping allows you to group grid data by several groups at once. To enable merged grouping, set the ASPxGridViewBehaviorSettings.MergeGroupsMode property to one of the following values: Always - merge groups automatically; Disabled - do not merge groups within the grid. Use the following properties to customize the merged group’s row: ASPxGridViewSettings.GroupFormatForMergedGroup - specif","codeBlocks":["protected void BootstrapGridView1_CustomColumnSort(object sender, BootstrapGridViewCustomColumnSortEventArgs e) {\n    CompareColumnValues(e);\n}\n\nprotected void BootstrapGridView1_CustomColumnGroup(object sender, BootstrapGridViewCustomColumnSortEventArgs e) {\n    CompareColumnValues(e);\n}\n\nprivate void CompareColumnValues(BootstrapGridViewCustomColumnSortEventArgs e) {\n    if (e.Column.FieldName == \"UnitPrice\") {\n        int res = 0;\n\n        double x = Math.Floor(Convert.ToDouble(e.Value1) / 10);\n        double y = Math.Floor(Convert.ToDouble(e.Value2) / 10);\n        res = Comparer.Default.Compare(x, y);\n        if (res < 0) res = -1;\n        else if (res > 0) res = 1;\n        if (res == 0 || (x > 9 && y > 9)) res = 0;\n\n        e.Result = res;\n        e.Handled = true;\n    }\n}\n\nprotected void BootstrapGridView1_CustomGroupDisplayText(object sender, BootstrapGridViewColumnDisplayTextEventArgs e) {\n    if (e.Column.FieldName == \"UnitPrice\") {\n        double d = Math.Floor(Convert.ToDouble(e.Value) / 10);\n        string displayText = string.Format(\"{0:c} - {1:c} \", d * 10, (d + 1) * 10);\n        if (d > 9) displayText = string.Format(\">= {0:c} \", 100);\n        e.DisplayText = displayText;\n    }\n}","<dx:BootstrapGridView ID=\"BootstrapGridView1\" runat=\"server\"\n    AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" DataSourceID=\"SqlDataSource1\" KeyFieldName=\"ProductID\"\n    OnCustomColumnSort=\"BootstrapGridView1_CustomColumnSort\"\n    OnCustomColumnGroup=\"BootstrapGridView1_CustomColumnGroup\"\n    OnCustomGroupDisplayText=\"BootstrapGridView1_CustomGroupDisplayText\">\n    <Settings ShowGroupPanel=\"true\" />\n    <Columns>\n        <dx:BootstrapGridViewTextColumn FieldName=\"ProductID\" ReadOnly=\"True\" VisibleIndex=\"0\">\n            <SettingsEditForm Visible=\"False\" />\n        </dx:BootstrapGridViewTextColumn>\n\n        <dx:BootstrapGridViewTextColumn FieldName=\"ProductName\" VisibleIndex=\"1\" />\n\n        <dx:BootstrapGridViewTextColumn FieldName=\"UnitPrice\" VisibleIndex=\"2\" GroupIndex=\"0\">\n            <Settings SortMode=\"Custom\" />\n            <PropertiesTextEdit DisplayFormatString=\"C\" />\n        </dx:BootstrapGridViewTextColumn>\n\n        <dx:BootstrapGridViewCheckColumn FieldName=\"Discontinued\" VisibleIndex=\"3\" />\n    </Columns>\n</dx:BootstrapGridView>"],"fetchedAt":"2026-01-19T11:29:29.297Z"},{"id":"xmbj6v","url":"https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetBootstrap/118184/grid-view/data-editing/batch-edit-mode","title":"Batch Edit Mode | ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls | DevExpress Documentation","headings":["General Information","IDE Productivity Tools","QA/Web Testing Tools","Desktop UI Controls","Controls"],"text":"Skip to main content Menu ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls All docs V 25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Search: Search Search in… DevExpress documentation only All DevExpress web resources Docs > Grid View > Data Editing > Batch Edit Mode All docs V25.2 25.2 25.1 Previous Versions 24.2 24.1 23.2 23.1 22.2 22.1 21.2 21.1 20.2 20.1 19.2 19.1 18.2 18.1 17.2 Filter table of contents Clear search input Full-text search ASP.NET Bootstrap Controls Overview Getting Started Demos and Sample Applications Project Configuration Security Considerations Grid View Binding to Data Data Representation Basics Data Summaries Filtering Grouping Sorting Cell Merging Focus and Navigation Data Editing Batch Edit Mode Master-Detail Relationship Adaptivity Templates Export Data-Toggle Attribute Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager Redistribution and Deployment .NET Framework API Reference Client API Reference Download CHM Batch Edit Mode Dec 08, 2023 4 minutes to read The Bootstrap Grid View control allows you to modify a batch of grid data on the client side and send it to the server in a single request. All user changes are maintained on the client side until an end-user explicitly saves or cancels them using the corresponding buttons displayed within the grid’s Status Bar. To enable the batch editing functionality, set the ASPxGridViewEditingSettings.Mode property to Batch. In this mode, data displayed on the current grid page can be edited using in-line editors. The GridViewBatchEditSettings.EditMode property allows you to specify which control element (a data cell or data row) is used to edit data. Prevent User Editing To prevent an end-user from editing column cells, set a column’s GridColumnEditFormSettings.Visible property to false. In this case, column cells cannot be switched to the edit mode. When an end-user navigates through cells using the TAB key, column cells are skipped. NoteSince data modification is performed on the client side in batch edit mode, the server-side ASPxGridView.StartEdit and ASPxGridView.AddNewRow methods are not in effect. Additionally, the client-side ASPxClientGridView.AddNewRow method does not perform a callback. Confirmation on Losing Changes If the grid contains modified data, it displays a “confirm” message before a grid callback or postback is performed. You can customize the message text using the ASPxGridTextSettings.ConfirmOnLosingBatchChanges property or disable it by setting the GridBatchEditSettings.ShowConfirmOnLosingChanges property to false. NoteSince row selection is based on row keys, and newly created rows do not exist in the grid (have no row keys), these newly created rows cannot be selected until they are saved. That’s why select check boxes of the newly created rows are disabled until they are saved.

Click rows, provided that the ASPxGridViewBehaviorSettings.AllowSelectByRowClick option is enabled. Click check boxes or radio buttons displayed within command column cells. The editor type (a radio button or check box) is automatically determined based on the currently active selection mode (a single or multiple row). To display check boxes or radio buttons, set the command column’s GridViewCommandColumn.ShowSelectCheckbox property to true. Alternatively, you can use the “Enable Selection” option within a grid’s Smart Tag menu. Use the Select command column item. To display this item, set the command column’s GridViewCommandColumn.ShowSelectButton property to true. The Bootstrap Grid View supports single and multiple row selection modes. You can switch the mode using a single option. To learn more, refer to the Multiple Row Selection topic. To get the Grid View‘s selection, use the ASPxGridView.Selection property. The object returned by this property provides methods that allow you to select and deselect individual rows or all rows, obtain the number of selected rows, etc. To respond to selection changes, handle the server-side ASPxGridBase.SelectionChanged event or the client-side ASPxClientGridView.SelectionChanged one. Example In this example, the client-side ASPxClientGridView.SelectionChanged event is handled to display selected contacts within the list box. Contact names are obtained using the ASPxClientGridView.GetSelectedFieldValues function.

The built-in pager enables end-users to navigate through Grid View data. It consists of navigation buttons: “next”, “last”, “previous”, “first”, “All”; an indicator that displays the current page number and the total number of pages, and a page size item allowing you to specify the maximum number of rows that can be displayed within a page. To access and customize pager settings, use the BootstrapGridView.SettingsPager property. The pager can be displayed above or below the rows, or on both sides. Use the ASPxGridPagerSettings.Position property to specify the pager’s position within the Grid View control. You can access the maximum number of rows displayed within a page using the ASPxGridViewPagerSettings.PageSize property. To disable page-mode navigation and display all rows within a grid, set the ASPxGridViewPagerSettings.Mode property to GridViewPagerMode.ShowAllRecords. Navigation in Code The active page is identified by the Grid View control’s ASPxGridBase.PageIndex property. Use this property to switch between pages in code.

The Grid View stores command columns together with its data columns within the ASPxGridView.Columns collection. Commands A command column is represented by the BootstrapGridViewCommandColumn class. It provides a set of commands that allow end-users to switch the Grid View to the edit mode, and update data, delete rows, etc. A command column allows multiple commands to be displayed within a cell. A single command is represented by a command item. There are eight command items. Command Description Property New Creates a new data row. ASPxGridViewCommandButtonSettings.NewButton Edit Switches ASPxGridView to an edit mode. ASPxGridViewCommandButtonSettings.EditButton Delete Deletes the current data row. ASPxGridViewCommandButtonSettings.DeleteButton Select Selects/deselects data rows.

A master-detail relationship is established through the CategoryID field. Retrieve Data From the Database Create Master and Detail ASPxGridViews Set up a Master-Detail Relationship 1. Retrieve Data From the Database To retrieve data from the database, use the SqlDataSource components: Master: Categories Detail: Products. Define a filter rule (see the image below). 2. Create Master and Detail ASPxGridView Create two BootstrapGridView controls. Bind the first grid (master) to the dsCategories. Bind the second grid (detail) to the dsProducts. Specify data source key fields for both grids using their ASPxGridBase.KeyFieldName property. 3. Set up a Master-Detail Relationship Invoke BootstrapGridView’s Template Designer by clicking the Edit Templates task. Select the DetailRow template. Drag the detail grid onto the Detail Row template. Handle the ASPxGridBase.BeforePerformDataSelect event to specify session values.

Data Cell Bands Hierarchy In contrast with Header Bands, the hierarchy of data cell bands is reflected not only by column headers, but by data rows as well. In a banded layout, each data record is presented by multiple rows organized in a hierarchical manner. Within a banded layout, any column can serve as a parent to other columns. A parent column stores its child columns in the BootstrapGridViewDataColumn.Columns collection property. To efficiently arrange a column header and data cells in the data cell band layouts (for instance, make the layout more compact), use the GridViewDataColumn.CellRowSpan and GridViewCommandColumn.CellRowSpan properties. They allow you to specify the number of rows that a column (i.e., a column header and data cells containing the column data) spans. The code sample below demonstrates how a banded layout can be defined at design-time.

In the template editing mode, the Visual Studio Design view displays the Template Designer allowing you to edit templates using standard design-time tools. Select the template to edit by clicking the Grid View’s smart tag and choosing it from the Display list. You can add a control to a template by dragging it from the toolbox and dropping it in the Template Designer’s client area. In this example, grid data rows are configured to display data in read-only text boxes. To bind a control in a template to data, click the control’s smart tag and select the Edit DataBindings option in the invoked menu. Select a property that you want to bind to data and specify which data field to bind to in the invoked dialog. The produced markup uses the default ASP.NET data binding expression syntax: ASPX <Templates> ... <DataRow> <dx:BootstrapTextBox ID=\"BootstrapTextBox1\" runat=\"server\" Text='<%# Eval(\"ShipCountry\") %>'> </dx:BootstrapTextBox> </DataRow> </Templates> Run the application and open the page in a browser to view the result. Using Markup The Grid View control utilizes the standard ASP.NET templating mechanism. Each template is an object implementing the ITemplate interface and can be declared using the ASP.NET markup syntax. Templates are declared within the BootstrapGridView.Templates property.
