These controls extend the classic DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms controls and target the ASP.NET Web Forms platform while using Bootstrap as a front-end framework. The DevExpress Bootstrap Controls are highly configurable and support numerous customization scenarios. The fundamental feature of DevExpress Bootstrap controls is their native rendering to Bootstrap CSS classes. When a DevExpress Bootstrap control renders its markup, the control does not strictly define its client-side presentation. Instead, the control’s presentation is supplied by the Bootstrap framework and Bootstrap themes. The described paradigm offers the following advantages. Application-level adaptivity Accessibility out of the box Consistent look-and-feel across browsers and devices Out-of-the box integration with Bootstrap themes supplied by Bootstrap contributors and third-party developers The inherent advantage of using Bootstrap for constructing web user interfaces is that it allows you to develop responsive layouts and provides your web application with production-quality visual design from the start. The markup to which the controls are rendered is based on standard Bootstrap classes and is intended to be integrated into bootstrap-powered page layouts. As a result, the controls behave as an integral part of the layout – they scale to the display size, use the look-and-feel settings from the current Bootstrap theme and visually merge with the page. NoteStyle settings of our ASP.NET WebForms controls can affect style settings of Bootstrap controls, for instance, when you place a Bootstrap control inside the ASPxPanel control. The following ASP.NET Bootstrap libraries and controls are provided by DevExpress. Grid View Card View Scheduler Spreadsheet Rich Text Editor Charts Sparkline Data Editors Site Navigation Site Layout File Manager NoteThe controls listed below are designed for Bootstrap v4 and may have rendering issues in Bootstrap v3. We do not plan to fix issues related to Bootstrap v3 in these controls. Spreadsheet FileManager RichEdit Sparkline (and Sparkline column) Ribbon Floating Action Button ColorEdit",

To start using DevExpress Bootstrap controls on pages of your web application, you need to resolve this dependency either by creating your project using the readily configured project template or by manually installing the required files to an existing project. Documents in this section cover both approaches: Start With Bootstrap Project Template Integration Into an Existing Project Note that Bootstrap Charts additionally require the DevExtreme library and its dependencies.

The Grid View provides numerous facilities for an end-user to sort, filter and group data against an unlimited number of rows, and delivers group and total summaries. On the server side, the Grid View control is represented by the BootstrapGridView class. The client-side functionality is handled by the BootstrapClientGridView class. Data Binding The Bootstrap Grid View control can display data from a database, an array or collection, as well as the public properties of collection elements. The Bootstrap Grid View control has been designed to work with large datasets. When bound to a data source in the database server mode, the Grid View only loads small portions of data on demand and all required data processing (such as grouping and sorting) is performed on the data server, which significantly reduces the application’s response time. Grouping The grouping feature allows your users to group data against an unlimited number of columns, giving them an unprecedented ability to analyze and edit information. End-users can apply grouping by dragging a column header and dropping it onto the Group Panel. Sorting The Bootstrap Grid View allows its data to be sorted by an unlimited number of data columns. Summaries The Bootstrap Grid View control supports both total and group summaries. A total summary represents the value of an aggregate function calculated over all rows within the grid and is displayed within the grid footer. A group summary represents the summary value calculated within a single group and is displayed in the group row or group footer. Data Editing The Grid View control provides end-user data editing functionality out of the box. The following edit modes are supported. Edit Form Edit Form and Display Row Popup Edit Form In-Line Editing Filtering Filtering allows you to display a subset of records that meet certain criteria in the data source. When filtering is applied to Bootstrap Grid View, only data rows that meet the specified criteria are displayed. Data can be filtered against a single data column or multiple data columns. End-users can build simple filter criteria, and apply it using the Filter Row or the Header Filter of a column. Master-Detail Relationship The Grid View control allows you to build master-detail layouts of any complexity and nesting depth by providing a detail row template, which defines the way detail data is presented. Export The Grid View Exporter control allows you to easily export grid data to a file or stream in one of the following supported formats: PDF XLS XLSX RTF CSV Export to the XLS and XLSX formats can be performed in the data-aware mode, in which the export engine maintains data grouping layout and automatically transforms summary items to corresponding Excel functions.

It fully supports data editing and delivers numerous end-user data shaping features, including facilities for end-user data filtering and sorting. Total summaries are also available out-of-the box. On the server side, the Card View control is represented by the BootstrapCardView class. The client-side functionality is handled by the BootstrapClientCardView class. Data Binding The Bootstrap Card View control can display data from a database, an array or collection, as well as the public properties of collection elements. The Bootstrap Card View control has been designed to work with large datasets. When bound to a data source in the database server mode, the Card View only loads small portions of data on demand and all required data processing (such as sorting) is performed on the data server, which significantly reduces the application’s response time. Sorting The Bootstrap Card View allows its data to be sorted by an unlimited number of data columns. Summaries The Bootstrap Card View control supports total summaries. A total summary represents the value of an aggregate function calculated over all card within the Card View and is displayed within the footer. Data Editing The Card View control provides end-user data editing functionality out of the box. The following edit modes are supported. Edit Form Popup Edit Form Batch Editing Filtering Filtering allows you to display a subset of records that meet certain criteria in the data source. When filtering is applied to Bootstrap Card View, only data items that meet the specified criteria are displayed. Data can be filtered against a single data column or multiple data columns. End-users can build simple filter criteria, and apply it using a column’s Header Filter. See Also Online Demos: Card View",
